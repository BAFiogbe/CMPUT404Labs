Question 4: What is the difference between the virtual environment and the not virtual environment python?
There is no distinction between the two; both the virtual environment and the local environment are running the same version since the most recent versions were installed in each. However, if a distinct version was set up in the virtual environment, it would, when activated, utilize a different version of the requests package compared to the local environment. Essentially, a virtual environment facilitates project-specific package management.
